# Snake Game 🐍
`@armeetjatyani` `2019` `HTML` `JavaScript`
## Intro
- I made this when I was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I taught myself by watching a YT tutorial 🎥 (That's usually how I learn most things)!
- I was new to programming 💻 at the time so excuse the syntax!
- This is one of the first games 🎮 I ever made.
- I came back after 2 yrs ⌚ to refresh the project with an updated `README.md`
